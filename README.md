BARINAKTANAL ( GET FROM THE SHELTER)

The project provides easy access to people who do not have easy access to animal shelters or people who do not have enough time to go to animal shelters.It aims to list the pets that they can choose to adopt from the shelters and to enable them to contact the shelter. It aims to provide the food and care support that animal shelters need more easily. The first milestone is to give management to selected employees in shelters in different cities and make them responsible for that shelter. The administrator is responsible for uploading the current pets in the shelter to the system and responding to the messages sent. Later milestones are more front-end oriented. Another milestone is to filter the pets according to the shelters/species/breeds and present them to the end user. Providing donations to shelters is the last milestone.

The project aims to facilitate the adoption of stray animals in the shelter. As it can be understood from here, the target audience of the project is animal lovers and people who want to adopt a pet. Thanks to our product, people will be able to easily access and communicate with animal shelters over the internet.
